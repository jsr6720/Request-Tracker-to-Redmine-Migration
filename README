== Introduction

This project was meant for transitioning from an RT based tracking system to Redmine.

This script was tested with RT 3.8.4 and Redmine 1.0.4

== WARNING

This script was created as a bare minimum to get a targeted RT installation to a redmine instance. Not all features are supported, or converted properly.

It would seem the entire migration could be done via the transaction table instead of 'mapping' things, but thats a project for another day.

== Usage

OPTIONAL: https://github.com/jystewart/html2textile for converting html text to textile. download and install otherwise RT plaintext is migrated.

Copy migrate_from_rt3.rake into the {redmine}/lib/tasks directory (with the other rake tasks).

execute $rake redmine:migrate_from_rt3 RAILS_ENV={production/development/test}
